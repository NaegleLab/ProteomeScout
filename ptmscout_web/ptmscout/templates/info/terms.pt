					<p>Neither NL nor WUSTL is obligated to review content posted by

						Content posted by any user to the Site does not reflect the
						opinions or views of NL, WUSTL, or the members, officers,
						employees, consultants, or students thereof. Neither NL nor WUSTL
						makes any warranty, whether express or implied, as to the
						accuracy, nature, or suitability of any content or material which

					<p>
				<li><b>Disputes</b><br> You are solely responsible for any
					interaction with other members or visitors of the Site. NL and WUSTL
					reserve the right but shall have no obligation to monitor disputes
					between you and any other user of the Site.
					<p>
				<li><b>Nature of Communications</b><br> By virtue of
					agreeing to this Terms of Service and using the Site, you
					acknowledge that the use of the Site results in interstate data
					transmissions. You further agree to comply with all applicable
					local laws regarding the transmission of data exported from the
					United States or the country in which you reside.
					<p>
				<li><b>Claims of Copyright Infringement</b><br> The
					Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides
					recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing
					on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If
					you believe in good faith that materials hosted by the Site
					infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send to WUSTL's DMCA
					agent a notice requesting that the material be
					removed or access to it blocked. The notice must include the
					following information (a) a physical or electronic signature of a
					person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive
					right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the
					copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple
					copyrighted works located on this website are covered by a single
					notification, a representative list of such works); (c)
					identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or
					the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably
					sufficient to allow the Site administrator to locate the material
					on the Site; (d) the name, address, telephone number and email
					address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement
					that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the
					material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the
					copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the
					information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of
					perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf
					of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If
					you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement
					has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send
					the Library a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet
					the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. Also,
					be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the
					DMCA.

				<li><b>Miscellaneous</b><br> In the event that any
					provision of the Terms of Use conflicts with the law under which
					the Terms of Use are to be construed or if any such provisions are

					Terms of Use, such provision will be deemed to be restated to
					reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the
					parties in accordance with applicable law, and the remainder of

					failure of any party (to the Terms of Use) to insist upon or
					enforce strict performance by any other party of any provision of
					the Terms of Use or to exercise any right under the Terms of Use
					will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent
					of such party's right to assert or rely upon any such provision or
					right in that or any other instance, rather, the same will be and
					remain in full force and effect. NL may assign its rights and
					obligations under these Terms of Use and, upon such assignment, NL and/or WUSTL
					may be relieved of any further obligation hereunder. You

					unenforceable provision of these Terms of Use will, at the election
					of NL or WUSTL, be deleted or modified to correct the defect and,
					regardless, the remainder of the terms of these Terms of Use will
					remain valid and enforceable. NL and WUSTL reserve the right to
					terminate free access to the Site including any or all content with
					or without notice to you. Furthermore, NL and WUSTL reserve the
					right to provide you with notice of such change by prominently
